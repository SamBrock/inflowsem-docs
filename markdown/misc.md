# Miscellaneous

## Command-line

It's important to have some familiarity with command-line interfaces in order to properly maintain and update the INFLOWSEM site. 

I'd recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) since it comes with a built in terminal that automatically opens the project directory. 

Alternatively, you could just open use Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe). I also like to use [cmder](https://cmder.net/) as it lets you set a default directory and open multiple command prompts at a time. 

### Commands

The only commands you need to know for the INFLOWSEM site are:
- `cd`: use this to change directory e.g. `cd C:\projects\inflowsem`.
- `cd ..`: goes to parent directory.
- `gulp`: used to run exported tasks defined in the gulpfile e.g. `gulp default`. This will only be available once you have followed the set-up guide in [gulp]().
- `npm`: used  to initlaise projects and install / uninstall plugins. e.g `npm i moment`. This will only be available once you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

You can see a full list of useful commands with this [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/media/pages/posts/command-line-cheat-sheet/1073300074-1593000062/command-line-cheat-sheet-large01.png). 

I've also found one specific to npm [here](https://devhints.io/npm).
